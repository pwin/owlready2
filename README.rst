Owlready2 is a module for ontology-oriented programming in Python 3, including an optimized RDF quadstore.

Owlready2 can:

 - Import OWL 2.0 ontologies in NTriples, RDF/XML or OWL/XML format

 - Export OWL 2.0 ontologies to NTriples or RDF/XML

 - Manipulates ontology classes, instances and properties transparently, as if they were normal Python objects

 - Add Python methods to ontology classes

 - Perform automatic classification of classes and instances, using the HermiT or Pellet reasoner (included)

 - Load DBpedia or UMLS (for medical terminology, using the integrated PyMedTermino2 submodule)

 - Tested up to 1 billion of RDF triples! (but can potentially support more)

 - In addition, the quadstore is compatible with the RDFlib Python module, which can be used to perform SPARQL queries
 
 - Finally, Owlready2 can also be used as an ORM (Object-Relational mapper) -- as a graph/object database, it beats Neo4J, MongoDB, SQLObject and SQLAlchemy in terms of performances
  
Owlready has been created by Jean-Baptiste Lamy at the LIMICS reseach lab.
It is available under the GNU LGPL licence v3.
If you use Owlready in scientific works, **please cite the following article**:

What can I do with Owlready2?
-----------------------------

Load an ontology from a local repository, or from Internet:

::

  >>> from owlready2 import *
  >>> onto_path.append("/path/to/your/local/ontology/repository")
  >>> onto = get_ontology("http://www.lesfleursdunormal.fr/static/_downloads/pizza_onto.owl")
  >>> onto.load()

Create new classes in the ontology, possibly mixing OWL constructs and Python methods:

::
  >>> with onto:
  ...     class NonVegetarianPizza(onto.Pizza):
  ...       equivalent_to = [
  ...         onto.Pizza
  ...       & ( onto.has_topping.some(onto.MeatTopping)
  ...         | onto.has_topping.some(onto.FishTopping)
  ...         ) ]
  ...       def eat(self): print("Beurk! I'm vegetarian!")

Access ontology class, and create new instances / individuals:

::

  >>> onto.Pizza
  pizza_onto.Pizza
  >>> test_pizza = onto.Pizza("test_pizza_owl_identifier")
  >>> test_pizza.has_topping = [ onto.CheeseTopping(),
  ...                            onto.TomatoTopping(),
  ...                            onto.MeatTopping  () ]

Export to RDF/XML file:

::

  >>> test_onto.save()

Perform reasoning, and classify instances and classes:

::

   >>> test_pizza.__class__
   onto.Pizza
   
   >>> # Execute HermiT and reparent instances and classes
   >>> sync_reasoner()
   
   >>> test_pizza.__class__
   onto.NonVegetarianPizza
   >>> test_pizza.eat()
   Beurk! I'm vegetarian !

Access to medical terminologies from UMLS:

::

  >>> from owlready2 import *
  >>> from owlready2.pymedtermino2.umls import *
  >>> default_world.set_backend(filename = "pym.sqlite3")
  >>> import_umls("umls-2018AB-full.zip", terminologies = ["ICD10", "SNOMEDCT_US", "CUI"])
  >>> default_world.save()
  
  >>> PYM = get_ontology("http://PYM/").load()
  >>> ICD10       = PYM["ICD10"]
  >>> SNOMEDCT_US = PYM["SNOMEDCT_US"]
  
  >>> SNOMEDCT_US[186675001]
  SNOMEDCT_US["186675001"] # Viral pharyngoconjunctivitis
  
  >>> SNOMEDCT_US[186675001] >> ICD10   # Map to ICD10
  Concepts([
    ICD10["B30.9"] # Viral conjunctivitis, unspecified
  ])
